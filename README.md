# intergrav/fonts

A fast, open-source CDN for open-source fonts. Inspired by xz/fonts. You can view available fonts in the `/serve` directory. More fonts to be added later! If you have any suggestions, open up an issue.

## Importing

In your CSS you could do:

```css
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/intergrav/fonts@1.x/serve/inter.min.css');
```

Or in your HTML's `<head>` you could do:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/intergrav/fonts@1.x/serve/inter.min.css">
```

Replace `inter` with the font name, of course.
